# Enable marketplace bidding

Run `migrations/202610080001_place_bid.sql` once in the Supabase project's SQL Editor, using an administrator session. The script runs in a transaction and assumes the existing public products and auctions columns used by the app. If it fails, the transaction rolls back; share the error without credentials rather than disabling checks.

The migration adds marketplace_bids and the authenticated place_marketplace_bid RPC. It records bids and updates the auction price atomically under a row lock. It rejects anonymous users, sellers bidding on their own products, unavailable listings, auctions outside their date range, invalid money amounts, and amounts that do not exceed both the current and starting prices. Minimum increase is PHP 0.01. It removes client insert/update/delete privileges on auctions; future auction management should use separately validated server functions. Do not restore direct client price-update privileges.

The application uses the existing Supabase public anon key and the signed-in user's session. Never put a service-role key in NEXT_PUBLIC variables. This migration does not need to change either deployed environment variable.

After installation and Hostinger deployment, sign in as a buyer other than the listing seller and use an active test auction. Confirm one successful bid updates its price and creates a marketplace_bids row. Verify a seller cannot bid, lower/equal bids fail, and expired auctions reject bids. Actual bid submission writes persistent records; use a designated test auction. Local PostgreSQL-compatible checks covered valid/rejected bid paths and direct-write protection. The production Supabase migration and real signed-in bidding have not been executed by Codex.
